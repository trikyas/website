<center><b>The Unicorn</b></center>

The unicorn template is a small but great starter for any project. Fork it and freely use it in any project private or commercial.

## The Unicorn
The Unicorn is a cool, but his only a little thing. The Unicorn guides me through my code and helps me with my mind altering experiences. Funly enough though.. He only seems to want to help me when I am actually having another mind altering experience. Otherwise. I never see him.
